# About HTWCleanCodersInRust
It's an implementation of [Uncle Bob's Hunt the Wumpus in clean architecture](https://github.com/unclebob/HTWCleanCoders/blob/master/HTW/src/htw/game/HuntTheWumpusGame.java) in Rust.
My aims are,
- To learn Rust Programming Language,
- To practice clean architecture,
- And to experience converting an application to another language.

Though it may be non-sensical to use clean architecture with a functional language, I felt this would be a good start.
